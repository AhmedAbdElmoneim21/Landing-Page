# Landing Page Project

## This is the first project for Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree

## Table of Contents
* Html and css mostly from udacity's startup project but i did some changes
* use Dom to generate a navbar
* smooth scroll with css
* add a scroll to top button
* add and remove active class when scrolling through the sections

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
